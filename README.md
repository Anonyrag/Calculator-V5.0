# 📘 Calculator Project — Versions 1.0 to 5.0

A simple, incremental JavaScript calculator built purely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, evolving through multiple versions to demonstrate learning, refactoring, and separation of concerns.

This project is perfect for **beginners**, **students**, and anyone wanting to understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, handles state, uses `localStorage`, and evolves into cleaner architecture with separated files.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains **four iterations** of a calculator, each improving upon the previous one:

* **Calculator 1.0** — A very first draft, with inline JavaScript and direct button-based expression building. 
* **Calculator 2.0** — Introduces a reusable function `updateCalculation()`, reduces repeated code, and adds division and clearing. 
* **Calculator 3.0** — Introduces **localStorage** so the calculator remembers your last result even after page reload. 
* **Calculator 4.0** — Improves UI feedback with on-screen display and separates logic into manageable functions. Also stores results persistently. This version is the final HTML demo before separating into HTML/CSS/JS files. 

There is also a **final version** (not shown here) where the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are separated for cleaner structure, professional organization, and scalability.

## 🎯 Features (Across Versions)

### ✔️ Basic Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Decimal support
* Clear/reset functionality
* Expression evaluation using JavaScript’s `eval()`
* Simple and clean UI with clickable buttons

### ✔️ Progression of Learning

Each version introduces new concepts:

| Version           | Key Concept Introduced                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.0**           | Inline scripting, basic DOM events                      |
| **2.0**           | Code reusability via functions                          |
| **3.0**           | Persistent state using `localStorage`                   |
| **4.0**           | UI display binding + structured functions               |
| **Final version** | Separation of HTML, CSS & JS files (scalable structure) |

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This project is intentionally structured to show how beginners progress from:

1. **Writing everything inside HTML**,
2. to **extracting functions**,
3. to **persisting data**,
4. to **separating code into modules**.

Perfect for:

* Students learning **JavaScript fundamentals**
* Beginners practicing **DOM manipulation**
* Anyone studying **stateful UI logic**
* Teaching step-by-step project evolution

Each version demonstrates a practical, understandable way to build a real project while improving coding habits.
